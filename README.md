🔐#Password Guessing Game:
A fun and interactive text-based game built in Python where the computer picks a secret password, and the user tries to guess it!

🚀 What This Project Does:
🧠 The computer randomly chooses a secret word (e.g., banana).
🤔 The user keeps guessing the word.
💡 After each guess, the game gives smart hints:
  ->How many letters are correct.
  ->How many are in the correct position.
📊 Tracks the total number of guesses.
🎯 Ends when the user successfully guesses the word.
🎮 Includes difficulty levels — shorter or longer passwords for an added challenge!

🔍 How It Works (Step-by-Step):
1. The program picks a random word from a list.
2. The user is informed about the length of the word.
3. The game prompts the user to guess.
4. After each guess:
  ✅ If correct → The user wins!
  ❌ If incorrect → The game gives helpful hints to get closer.
5. The game loops until the correct password is guessed.

💡 Bonus:
You can easily extend the game by:
Adding a word bank from a file.
Introducing scoreboards or a timer.
